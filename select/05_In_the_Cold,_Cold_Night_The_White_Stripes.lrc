[00:09.45] I saw you standing in the corner
[00:13.24] On the edge of a burning light
[00:17.89] I saw you standing in the corner
[00:33.89] 
[00:22.24] Come to me again in the cold, cold night
[00:29.21] In the cold, cold night
[00:40.71] 
[00:35.19] You make me feel a little older
[00:39.55] Like a full grown woman might
[00:44.42] But when you're gone I grow colder
[01:01.42] 
[00:48.82] Come to me again in the cold, cold night
[00:55.35] In the cold, cold night
[01:06.85] 
[01:00.68] I hear you walking by my front door
[01:05.64] I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
[01:09.58] I don't care what other people say
[01:13.94] I'm going to love you, anyway
[01:28.44] 
[01:17.94] Come to me again in the cold, cold night
[01:25.19] In the cold, cold night
[01:36.69] 
[01:57.29] I can't stand it any longer
[02:01.45] I need the fuel to make my fire burn bright
[02:05.64] So don't fight it any longer
[02:19.64] 
[02:10.41] Come to me again in the cold, cold night
[02:17.13] In the cold, cold night
[02:28.63] 
[02:21.96] And I know that you feel it too
[02:26.65] When my skin turns into glue
[02:30.35] You will know that it's warm inside
[02:34.30] And you'll come run to me
[02:38.47] In the cold, cold night
[02:42.60] In the cold, cold night
[02:46.90] In the cold, cold night
[02:51.36] In the cold, cold night
