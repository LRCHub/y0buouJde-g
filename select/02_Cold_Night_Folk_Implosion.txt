A cold night, in my brain
Up ahead a light
And my luck might change

(It crept up, crept up on me)
(It crept up, came suddenly)

Looking out the window
Flying down the backroad
Passing on the blindside

It was good to take a load off
Riding on the right side
Make a little small talk
I can't say no to that
I just need a ride

(It crept up, crept up on me)
(It crept up, came suddenly)

Looking out the window
Flying down the backroad
Passing on the blindside

A hand on my left thigh
Giving me a weird smile
A cold night, in my brain
Take another ride, and my luck might change
