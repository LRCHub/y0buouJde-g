[00:02.69] I can't talk to today
[00:05.32] The phone will have to ring
[00:11.78] I'll keep the blind pulled down
[00:16.25] I'll keep the bedroom locked
[00:30.25] 
[00:43.42] I think the window froze
[00:50.61] I think my head is broke
[00:57.02] I think my toes won't move
[01:02.49] I think my head is broke
