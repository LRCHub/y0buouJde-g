```
Idon'tbelieveinmyself
高く飛ぶ
They think I'm a fool
They think I'm a fool
Rain drop, 目を覚ましても
Same old, 何も変わらない
Grow up, mirrorの私に言うの
泣いても変わらないと
I don't know where to go
叶えたい夢があるのに
あの子みたいにはなれない
慣れない
I don't believe in myself (But I don't care)
高く飛ぶ (With my new shoes)
They think I'm a fool (I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care
Watch me, this is me
転んだ 数だけ
I've got nothing but this fire
I'll show you what I can do
Cold night (Cold night), no light (No light)
Blood from my knee no one ever sees me
Cold night (Cold night), no light (No light)
Blood from my knee no one ever sees me
(Cold night) Yeah (No light) 光ってた
(Blood from my knee no one ever sees me) 諦めら
れないくらいに光っていたんだ
(Cold night) Yeah (No light)この夢だけは離さない
(Blood from my knee no one ever sees me) 転ん
だって立ち上がって絶対
I don't believe in myself (But I don't care)
高く飛ぶ (With my new shoes)
They think I'm a fool (I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care
Watch me, this is me
転んだ 数だけ
I've got nothing but this fire
I'll show you what I can do
What I can do, what can I do
What I can do, what can I do
Cold night (What I can do), no light (What I can
do)
Blood from my knee no one ever sees me (What I
can do)
I don't believe in myself (But I don't care)
高く飛ぶ (With my new shoes)
They think I'm a fool (I don't care)
I don't care, I don't care (I don't care)
Watch me, this is me (I'm not who I used to be)
転んだ 数だけ (They said I couldn't, now look at
me)
I've got nothing but this fire (Yeah I've got
nothing, I've got nothing)
I'll show you what I can do (Just watch, I'll
make it)
